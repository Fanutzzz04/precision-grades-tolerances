Application for calculating precision grades and tolerances (ISO 2768)

This project proposes the development of a software application that automates the process of identifying the fundamental tolerance grade. Unlike the classical approach, where the grade is known first and the deviations are then determined, this application works in reverse: the user enters the limit deviations (upper and lower), and the algorithm calculates the tolerance zone and compares it with the standardized database (Table 1.0) to return the correct precision grade (for example: IT7, IT8, etc.).
